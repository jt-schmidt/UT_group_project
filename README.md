## Selected Topic: Life Expectancy Data Analysis

## Reason
During group formation & initial discussion, topic brainstorming ranged between:
* Topics of interest; e.g. Spotify podcast, Texas industry growth
* Example datasets; e.g. initial database creation for twitter feeds of top tech companies
* Uniqueness of application: e.g. UCI dataset exploring relation between mobile device accelerometer and alcohol consumption

Ultimately, group determined focus of the assignment should be:
* Cohesive & effective group communication / coordination
* Emphasis on dataset selection where learned principles from the course could be definitvely applied.  Includes:
  * Dataset where machine learning model can be applied
  * Large enough row x column count for sufficient complexity where machine learning is more meaningful
  * Small enough row x column count to easily add dataset to Github repository for demonstration of learned principles

Overall, result of this group project sets foundation for continued growth in learned concepts over past 24 weeks.
